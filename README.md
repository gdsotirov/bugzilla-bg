# Bugzilla in Bulgarian

This is the official translation of [Bugzilla](https://www.bugzilla.org/) in
Bulgarian language. The project provides translated templates with clarification
of common technical abbreviations (e.g. HTTP, LDAP, etc.).

Please, see [Localized Versions](https://www.bugzilla.org/download/#localizations)
for other localizations.

# Supported versions

The translation effort began in the summer of 2005, so
[all versions](https://www.bugzilla.org/releases/) since Bugzilla 2.18.1 are
translated. Currently supported versions are:

* [Bugzilla 4.4.13](https://github.com/gdsotirov/bugzilla-bg/releases/tag/bugzilla-bg-4.4.13) (old stable);
* [Bugzilla 5.0.6](https://github.com/gdsotirov/bugzilla-bg/releases/tag/bugzilla-bg-5.0.6) (current stable).

# Translators

The original translation and updates are provided by Georgi D. Sotirov
([maintainer](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:L10n:Localization_Teams#Bulgarian)
of Bugzilla localization in Bulgarian).

I would like to give special thanks to Ivan Mednev for his help with improving
this translation over the years.

Contributions in the form of corrections, additions and/or suggestions for
better translation and are always welcome!

# License

The translation was originally licensed under GPL-2.0, but the current license
